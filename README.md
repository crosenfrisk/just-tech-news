Build the back end for a full-stack application, Just Tech News, a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. 

Using Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, we simplify MySQL queries, and by using password hashing users can create secure passwords.
The application is connected to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku which allows it to run remotely.
