  Users can create an account by viewing the deployed page from [Heroku](https://limitless-meadow-27810.herokuapp.com/), or if they prefer, can download a copy of the repository and run from the command line using `npm start` and then open in their web browser directing to `http://localhost.3001/`.

  
  ## Credits

  To write the fullstack application for the Just Tech News website, I needed to use the following NMP:
  * bcrypt 
  * connect-session-sequelize
  * dotenv 
  * express
  * express-handlebars
  * express-session
  * handlebars
  * mysql2
  * sequelize
  
  * The application is also connected to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku which allows it to run remotely.

  ## Test
  There are tests that were created to improve the UX of the site, formatting date, pluralization of words, and trimming URLs to be more readable. They all currently pass since the functions are written, but if you wanted to add any additional tests for future functions, the /`tests/helpers.test.js` file would be the best place to start. Running any tests from the command line using `npm run test`.
